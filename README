NAME
    coretypes - my int, double, string $@%variables

DESCRIPTION
    Parse int, double and string as type, provide packages and implement the
    changed datastructures.

    We have to support two different implementations:

    As backwards compatible CPAN extension implemented only as slow tie
    methods, and 2nd in core with patched parser hooks targetting 5.18 and
    faster and smaller structures.

    Use those 3 new native types in declarations of lexical scalars, arrays
    and hashes, but not in globals.

        my int $i;         # no magic allowed, with type-optim and type checks.
        my double $d;      #               -"-
        our string $s;     #               -"-

        my int @array;     # typed IV array, with type-optim. and type checks.
        my int @array[20]; # typed and fixed-sized, with type and size checks.

        my string %hash;   # typed PV hash, with type-optim. and type checks

        our string %hash :constant = {'foo' => 'bar'};
                           # perfect hash with type-optim. and type checks

    This package does NOT handle attributes, as there is no compile-time
    attribute hook for my lexicals yet. So optimizations for :constant or
    :read-only are deferred to later.

    Possible constant syntax to replace attributes:

        my constant string %hash;
